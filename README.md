# Scala in a day

Scala in a day. Learning from the people who really use it.

This repo contains the modules for a 1-Day training that we occasionally deliver. Students are asked to clone it and only to look at the solutions when you get stuck. Afterall it is you who wants to learn something.

To get going you need to install ...

* Scala
* Sbt
* Git

You then need to clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/gilt/scala-1-day.git`. Afterwards you should be able to go to 000.setup and run `sbt "run-main javax.HelloWorld"`, `sbt "run-main scalax.HelloWorld"` (this will not work :)) and `sbt "run-main solution.HelloWorld"`.
